ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mrunal Reddy Ragi!

Iâ€™m from Hyderabad, Telangana, India. I started my journey in healthcare as a dentist, earning my degree in Bachelor of Dental Science. While working in a dental clinic, I discovered a fascination for dataâ€”how itâ€™s collected, analyzed, and used to make impactful decisions.

That curiosity led me to take a leap and pursue a Masterâ€™s in Health Data Sciences. Itâ€™s been a challenging transition from clinical practice to the world of data, but Iâ€™m absolutely loving the process. Every step feels like Iâ€™m unlocking new ways to improve healthcare through insights and innovation.

Iâ€™m here to connect, learn, and contribute to projects that blend healthcare and data science. Letâ€™s create something amazingÂ together!
